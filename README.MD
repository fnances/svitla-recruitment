Set up project:
  - cd frontend && yarn
  - cd backend && yarn

Running project:
  - cd frontend && ng serve 
  - cd frontend && yarn debug 


The backend side was totally me having fun with websockets and trying things out. 
I am aware that solution was much simpler and didn't require most of this stuff that I was trying to recreate / fake.
